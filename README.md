# Assignment - Promises

## Overview 
Understand how to build and consume Promises  

## Learning Objectives  
- Proper use of the 'new' keyword to create a Promise 
- Proper use of Promise 'resolve' and 'reject' methods 
- Proper use of Promise 'then' and 'catch' methods  
- Handling a Promise with the 'async' and 'await' keywords 

## Requirements
1. You will be writing several functions, stub them out now 
2.    backend  
-    Builds a Promise using the 'new' keyword 
3.    builtInFuncs  
-    Consumes a Promise using built-in Functions 
4.    asyncAwait 
-    Consumes a Promise using the 'async' and 'await' keywords 
5.    The backend function is where you will build your Promise using the 'new' keyword 
6.    The backend function takes in a single argument  
-    Will be a number passed from the two consuming functions 
-    Assign a new Promise to a variable 
-    Return that variable 
7.    Within the Promise handler write an If/Else statement  
-    Check if the number is even 
-    If Even, resolve with a string  
-    If Odd, reject with a string 
8.    The builtInFunc function is where you handle your Promise with built-in Functions 
9.    Call the backend Function, pass in an even number 
 -   Write code to capture and log the response from the returned Promise 
10.    Call the backend Function again, pass in an odd number 
-    Write code to capture and log the response from the returned Promise 
11.    The asyncAwait function is where you handle your Promise with the 'async' and 'await' keywords 
12.    Call the backend Function, pass in an even number 
-    Write code to capture and log the response from the returned Promise 
 13.   Call the backend Function again, pass in an odd number 
-    Write code to capture and log the response from the returned Promise
